                            Feeling a tad hesitant about commitment, are we? Just kidding ????. Rest assured, we’ll be
                            by your side throughout the process, guiding you at every turn. We’ve worked hard to make
                            our processes as swift and seamless as possible for both you and us.

                            Upon signing the agreement, our title company typically needs some documentation from you.
                            This is to gather payoff details and order title reports, ensuring you’re entitled to sell
                            your property. Once you’ve provided these documents – which usually takes less than 15
                            minutes – your role is essentially done. You just sit back and wait until your chosen
                            closing date.

                            The entire process, from beginning to end, has taken less than an hour for many of our
                            clients. That’s quite the norm, actually. While we ensure efficiency, we also cherish the
                            opportunity to build relationships and get to know our clients.

                            Not in the typical sense that you would expect in a conventional home sale. Traditional
                            sales involve a certified inspector thoroughly examining the property, which is highly
                            beneficial for potential home buyers but not for us, as investors. We usually take a mere 20
                            to 25 minutes to conduct a speedy tour of the house, which allows us to draft our offer.

                            On rare occasions, if we need to obtain a measurement or quotation following an accepted
                            offer, we will always consult with you first. However, this is not a frequent occurrence,

                            Certainly not (and we promise not to tell our painter we borrowed his phrase). There are two
                            key reasons why we won’t lowball you. Firstly, it conflicts with our fundamental ethos of
                            serving and assisting you. Secondly, you know the saying about running a business like a
                            business to avoid going bust? If we were to deceive homeowners and provide lowball offers,
                            we’d only manage to flip a few homes annually.

                            With a business model that focuses on volume, we purchase around 50 properties each year.
                            Therefore, it is mutually beneficial to provide a fair offer that results in a win-win
                            situation. We then apply the same approach with the next homeowner.

                            We won’t mislead you by claiming we can offer the full market value for your property.
                            Unfortunately, no one can make such an offer and still turn a profit. However, thanks to our
                            lean, efficient operations and established reputation, our proven methodology allows us to
                            make higher offers than nearly any other similar firm.

                            Are you set for the disclosure of our secret strategy? The tactic that consistently has
                            people scratching their heads, wondering why our offers consistently outstrip those of our
                            rivals? It all begins with the After Repair Value (ARV). Almost everything we do as a
                            company has an end goal in sight, much like how we discuss your requirements, identifying
                            your desired outcome.

                            Let’s take a quick journey through our rationale. We’re going to buy your home with cash,
                            expedite the closing, and then employ our professional team to refurbish it for a quick sale
                            (ideally). People are attracted to homes that are modern and unused – think gleaming
                            stainless steel and carpets that have never been tread on.

                            Keeping the final image of the house in mind, we then reach out to our realtor to compare
                            sales of similar properties via the multiple listing service (MLS). For instance, we might
                            say,

                            “Hello, Billy. We’ve got a 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom, 2800 sq foot property on a quarter-acre
                            plot. It will boast a newly fitted kitchen and bathrooms, fresh paint and flooring,
                            stainless steel appliances, contemporary light fittings, landscape improvements, and a new
                            garage door in front of a freshly painted house.”

                            Using his expertise, Billy then provides us with the most comparable listings for recently
                            sold properties in close proximity (usually within half a mile).

                            Now that we have our selling price (the After Repair Value), we can then use a
                            straightforward calculation to deduce our fair cash offer. With years of experience flipping
                            homes, and an understanding of how to ensure we all benefit, we’ve found this formula to be
                            the most effective – and it enables us to present you with the maximum cash offer.


                            ARV (Estimated Value Post-Renovation) – Rehabilitation Budget – Selling Expenses – Profit =
                            Our Cash Offer Let’s delve into what these terms mean!
                            Following that, we’ll illustrate how it all fits together and to assure you that we strictly
                            adhere to this formula, we’ll examine an actual property we recently flipped in a real-life
                            Case Study! ARV Drawing on years of home flipping expertise, we’ve established a method that
                            enables us to present fair cash offers to homeowners. The process begins with calculating
                            the After Repair Value (ARV) of the property, which is an estimate of the value after all
                            necessary improvements and upgrades are made. We then deduct the projected cost of the
                            renovations, the selling expenses (including commissions and closing costs), and our
                            intended profit margin, which tends to be around 10% of the ARV.

                            Our profit may seem substantial to some, but it’s essential to sustain our business and to
                            continue assisting homeowners. We’ve found that unexpected complications often emerge during
                            renovations, underscoring the importance of a contingency fund for unforeseen expenses. To
                            help you grasp our formula, let’s delve deeper. The ARV is the projected value of the home
                            after all required repairs and upgrades are made. The rehabilitation budget encompasses the
                            projected cost of these renovations. Selling expenses cover commissions, closing fees, and
                            taxes, which we generally estimate to be around 10% of the property’s value. Our target
                            profit margin also represents about 10% of the ARV. Transparency is a key tenet of our
                            approach, which is why we ensure our cash offer is free from hidden charges or commissions.

                            We aim to offer a fair and honest solution for homeowners seeking to rapidly and efficiently
                            sell their property. You might question why we target a 10% profit margin. The answer is
                            that renovations often encounter unforeseen challenges, necessitating a contingency fund for
                            unexpected costs. Despite having a set profit target for each project, we acknowledge that
                            not all renovations go smoothly. We’ve dealt with unexpected hurdles in the past, but our
                            extensive experience has equipped us to manage such situations. Our cash offer is precisely
                            what it sounds like – the amount we can provide for your property, at a closing date of your
                            choosing. We value transparency, which is why we don’t include any hidden costs or
                            commissions. Our aim is to provide a simple and stress-free solution for homeowners who wish
                            to sell their property swiftly and without hassle.

                        We pulled comps on the home and determined when fully remodeled we should be able to sell around
                        $360k. It would cost us about $36k in commissions and fees to resell the home and we did a
                        walkthrough and estimated about $30k in repairs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        We made Mike an offer for $268k which Mike thought was more than fair given the condition. Our
                        profit goal formula was as followed: $360k (After repair value) – $36k selling cost – $30k in
                        repairs = $26k profit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        Here’s how the story fully unfolded. We ended up holding onto the home for 3 months to rehab the
                        house. We ended up spending $45k on the repairs, we had 2 major appliances break, and the
                        furnace go out in the short 3 months we owned it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        We bought this in September and sold this in January, once finished this still took 2 months to
                        sell. What happened from September to December was incredible.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        Because of the extremely tight demand, homes appreciated almost 7% in the 5 months we had this
                        property so when we listed the property we actually got an offer for $385k (we ended up doing
                        about a thousand dollars in requested repairs and providing a home warranty).
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        Here’s how the final numbers played out. Sale price of $385,000 – $45k in repairs – $38k
                        commissions and closing costs = profit of $34k.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        We ended up profiting slightly more than what we anticipated due to the extreme appreciation.
                        Due to almost 10k in unexpected repairs this was a very unexpected blessing.

                        So when Mike came to us to sell his house our realtor told us the house in it’s current
                        condition was probably around $315k. It needed 30k plus in repairs but someone might buy it as a
                        project home. If Mike wanted to list with a realtor his numbers would have looked more like
                        this:
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        Sales price of $315k – Commissions and closings costs of $31k (6% real estate commissions, 3-4%
                        closing costs) netting him $284k, with the possibility of 4-6 months to sell, because the house
                        did not a ton of work.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        Selling with a realtor in 4-6 months net’s Mike $284k while selling to us for Cash netted Mike
                        $268k. This was a $16k difference.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        But wait! The 4-6 months Mike that it took Mike to sell his home, he still has to pay the
                        mortgage, maintain insurance, pay the utilities and taxes – these easily added up to almost 2k
                        per month.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        If Mike sold it in 4 months we have to subtract another roughly $8k in his holding costs
                        bringing Mike’s total difference to around $8k.

                    There are actually tons of scams out there if you need to sell my house fast Spokane. A large
                    portion of the websites that claim they “sell your house fast” are actually lead gen sites. What’s
                    that you ask? They are websites that don’t actually buy your homes, they sell your data (leads) to
                    people. Like investors, realtors, anyone who will pay.
                </p>
                <p class="buy-house-spokane-paragraph py-3">
                    They collect your information and then typically sell it for one to two hundred dollars per lead.
                    We’ve never bought these leads because that’s not our style but we know of most of the websites that
                    do this.

                    A good way to know you are actually dealing with the people that will be buying your house is to
                    check out the testimonials – were other people satisfied with the process? We also encourage you to
                    check google reviews, better business bureau ratings and best but not last – give us a call. You’ll
