                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">A Coeur d’Alene native, Chad Young grew up in the
                        area. This is his family’s third generation here. Formerly a Sergeant in the Army Reserves, he
                        enjoys challenges and learning new things. Due to his experience in the army as well as banking
                        and finance, he was inspired to start his own businesses.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        After finding the love of his life, Chad and Bree started a janitorial business. The business
                        was built over ten years and then sold so they could specialize in house flipping. He is the
                        proud papa of two handsome sons and one beautiful daughter. Having an amazing church and being
                        able to backpack to lakeside mountains are two of the perks of their lives.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        As a child, Bree Young moved to Idaho. They settled down in the area because her parents wanted
                        to give her a better future. Bree attended a rival high school before attending Bible college
                        shortly before marrying Chad. Besides being a proud mother of three, she is an excellent cook,
                        and her Latin passion adds a spark to life. Whenever she’s not being Wonder Woman, she’s
                        flipping houses. She excels at demos and can make a home look modern and inviting.

                            commissions or closing costs, we make it easier for people to get out of their homes fast
                            without any hassle.

                            Realtors typically entail a 10% commission. With The Easy Home Buyer, you can save thousands

                            Potential buyers may expect you to make costly repairs and renovations before they will
                            offer a fair price for your property. Listing with a real estate agent also means waiting
                            months — sometimes years — for a buyer to come along who is willing to pay the asking price.
                            This doesn’t have to be your reality when it comes time to sell your house. The Easy Home
                            Buyer offers cash for homes in Spokane and can help you move on with your life.

                            When you’re looking to sell your home fast, one of the most popular options is to list it
                            with a realtor. While this option may be great for some sellers, it doesn’t always work out
                            as well as expected.

                            The process can involve an extensive amount of time and effort that many people simply don’t
                            have or want to devote. From having multiple showings to making repairs and cleaning up the
                            property so that it’s more appealing — these are all tasks that need to be completed before
                            you can expect an offer from a potential buyer. Well, not with us!
