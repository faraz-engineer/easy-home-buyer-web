                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">A Coeur d’Alene native, Chad Young grew up in the
                        area. This is his family’s third generation here. Formerly a Sergeant in the Army Reserves, he
                        enjoys challenges and learning new things. Due to his experience in the army as well as banking
                        and finance, he was inspired to start his own businesses.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        After finding the love of his life, Chad and Bree started a janitorial business. The business
                        was built over ten years and then sold so they could specialize in house flipping. He is the
                        proud papa of two handsome sons and one beautiful daughter. Having an amazing church and being
                        able to backpack to lakeside mountains are two of the perks of their lives.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sell-my-house-fast-spokane-paragraph">
                        As a child, Bree Young moved to Idaho. They settled down in the area because her parents wanted
                        to give her a better future. Bree attended a rival high school before attending Bible college
                        shortly before marrying Chad. Besides being a proud mother of three, she is an excellent cook,
                        and her Latin passion adds a spark to life. Whenever she’s not being Wonder Woman, she’s
                        flipping houses. She excels at demos and can make a home look modern and inviting.
